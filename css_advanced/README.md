# CSS & Style Implementation – Advanced HTML Project

This project builds upon the **HTML, Advanced** concepts and focuses on applying **CSS styling** to create a clean, responsive, and visually appealing webpage. The main objective is to bring the static structure to life by following a design prototype and implementing it with modern styling techniques.

## 📝 Important Notes

- **Fonts:**  
  If your computer does not have the fonts used in the Figma design, you can download them here:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/2GiLUC7TtmTQTAnS1dlPKQ) (custom font)

- **Values in Float:**  
  Some spacing or size values in Figma may be in decimals (e.g., `12.5px`).  
  **Feel free to round them** for simplicity (e.g., `13px`).

- **HTML Updates:**  
  You may need to add extra images (like logos) or adjust the HTML structure slightly to match the design.
