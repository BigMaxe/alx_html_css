# CSS Fundamentals Project

This project focuses on building a foundational understanding of **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** by applying styles to HTML elements using best practices. The goal is to create structured, styled, and standards-compliant web pages using only **HTML** and **CSS** â€” without any external libraries or frameworks.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to confidently explain:

- **What is CSS:**  
  CSS stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*. It is used to describe the presentation of an HTML document â€” including colors, layout, fonts, spacing, etc.

- **How to Add Style to an Element:**  
  You can add styles using:
  - Inline styles: `<p style="color: red;">Text</p>`
  - Internal styles: using `<style>` in the `<head>`
  - External stylesheets: via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`

- **What is a Class:**  
  A class is a reusable identifier for styling groups of elements. Defined in HTML as `class="example"` and used in CSS as `.example { }`.

- **What is a Selector:**  
  A selector is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements. E.g., `p`, `.class`, `#id`, or `div > p`.

- **How to Compute CSS Specificity Value:**  
  Specificity defines which CSS rule takes precedence. It is calculated based on:
  - Inline styles: 1000
  - IDs: 100
  - Classes/attributes/pseudo-classes: 10
  - Elements/pseudo-elements: 1

- **What are Box Properties in CSS:**  
  Every HTML element is a box made up of:
  - Content
  - Padding
  - Border
  - Margin  
  These control spacing, layout, and element separation.

- **How Does the Browser Load a Webpage:**  
  Browsers read HTML from top to bottom, parse the DOM, then apply CSS and render content. CSS can override styles based on specificity and cascading rules.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Requirements

- All files end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file is placed at the root of the project folder.
- **No external libraries** (e.g., Bootstrap, React, NodeJS).
- Only use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript** (if needed).
- Code must validate correctly via [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
